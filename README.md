# Chatbot-with-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-Using-Generative-AI
AI developer to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide enhanced, data-driven responses. The chatbot will leverage a generative AI model, such as GPT-4, and pull information from external data sources (e.g., a knowledge base, documents, or an API) to generate accurate, contextually relevant answers.

This project will start with the development of the PoC. If the work meets expectations, I will consider providing more projects in the future to further enhance the chatbot or expand its capabilities.

Project Scope (PoC):

Key Features:
Handle simple user queries (e.g., customer support, FAQs, product info).
Retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base or document repository.
Use generative AI (GPT) to form responses based on the retrieved information.

Responsibilities:

=================
To build a Proof of Concept (PoC) chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we can break down the process into several key stages. This approach will combine document retrieval (using something like Elasticsearch or FAISS) with generative AI (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4). Here's a Python-based approach to get you started.
Required Libraries:

    Elasticsearch: To handle document retrieval.
    OpenAI API: To use GPT-3 or GPT-4 for generating responses.
    Flask: To expose the chatbot as a web API.
    Pandas: For handling data if required.

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

You will need to install the required Python libraries to work with Elasticsearch and OpenAI:

pip install openai elasticsearch flask pandas

Step 2: Set Up Elasticsearch

You can run Elasticsearch locally or use a hosted version (e.g., Elastic Cloud or AWS). For local installation, refer to Elasticsearch installation guide.

Once Elasticsearch is set up, we’ll assume you have indexed your documents into Elasticsearch.
Step 3: Code Implementation

Here’s the basic PoC for integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology using Elasticsearch and OpenAI's GPT-3/4.

import openai
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
import json
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Initialize Elasticsearch client
es = Elasticsearch(['http://localhost:9200'])  # assuming Elasticsearch is running locally

# Define the Elasticsearch index to query
INDEX_NAME = "knowledge_base"  # The index name where your documents are stored

# Function to retrieve documents from Elasticsearch based on query
def retrieve_documents(query, num_results=5):
    body = {
        "query": {
            "match": {
                "content": query  # Assuming documents are stored with a 'content' field
            }
        }
    }
    response = es.search(index=INDEX_NAME, body=body, size=num_results)
    documents = [hit['_source']['content'] for hit in response['hits']['hits']]
    return documents

# Function to generate a response using GPT-4 based on retrieved documents
def generate_response(query, retrieved_documents):
    # Join the retrieved documents to form context for GPT-4
    context = "\n".join(retrieved_documents)
    
    # Send the query and context to GPT-4 for response generation
    prompt = f"Context:\n{context}\n\nQuestion:\n{query}\n\nAnswer:"
    
    # Get GPT-4 response
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",  # Or "gpt-3.5-turbo" if using GPT-3
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=300,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    answer = response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()
    return answer

# Endpoint for querying the chatbot
@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    data = request.json
    query = data.get("query")
    
    if not query:
        return jsonify({"error": "Query not provided"}), 400
    
    # Step 1: Retrieve relevant documents from Elasticsearch
    retrieved_documents = retrieve_documents(query)
    
    # Step 2: Generate a response using GPT-4
    response = generate_response(query, retrieved_documents)
    
    return jsonify({"answer": response})

# Run the Flask app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

Explanation of Key Components:
1. Elasticsearch Setup:

    Elasticsearch is set up locally and queries the index knowledge_base to retrieve documents relevant to the user's query.
    The documents in Elasticsearch should have a field like content which holds the actual information of your knowledge base.

Example document structure:

{
    "title": "Product FAQ",
    "content": "Here are some frequently asked questions about our product..."
}

2. Retrieve Documents:

    The function retrieve_documents queries the Elasticsearch index for relevant documents using a basic match query on the content field.
    You can fine-tune this by adjusting the query parameters or using more complex queries (e.g., BM25, semantic search).

3. Generate AI Response:

    After retrieving the top n documents, the context is passed to GPT-4 via the OpenAI API.
    The GPT model will then generate a response based on the context of the retrieved documents, allowing it to give a more accurate and relevant answer.

4. Flask API:

    The chatbot is served as a simple API using Flask, where users send POST requests to the /ask endpoint with the query.
    Example request payload:

    {
      "query": "What is the return policy?"
    }

    The server will respond with a generated answer based on the documents retrieved from Elasticsearch.

Step 4: Testing the Chatbot

Once the Flask application is running, you can test the chatbot by sending requests to the /ask endpoint. You can use tools like Postman or curl to test the API.

Example using curl:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ask -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What is the return policy?"}'

Step 5: Sample Output

If the chatbot successfully retrieves relevant documents, the response might look like:

{
  "answer": "Our return policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase with a valid receipt. Please visit our website for more details."
}

Enhancements for Future Work:

    Advanced Query Handling: Implement more sophisticated search methods, like semantic search using models like BERT or Sentence-BERT.
    Personalization: Store user interaction data and adapt the response style or knowledge base over time.
    Error Handling: Improve error handling for cases when Elasticsearch is unavailable or if GPT-4 fails to generate a response.
    Scalability: Implement horizontal scaling for handling more traffic (e.g., deploying with Docker, Kubernetes).
    Advanced Document Retrieval: Implement other methods like FAISS for vector-based search if you have high-dimensional data.

This PoC should give you a solid foundation for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot that can enhance responses with external knowledge bases, and the architecture is scalable for further refinement.
